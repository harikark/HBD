			<h3>Lucky</h3>
	 		<p class="big"> Hello all you gentlepeople. My name is Lockeforde 'Lucky' Blackbear Boztepe. I was born on the cold fall morning of November 10, 2012...and boy was I (and still am) cute. I am actually the most photogenic creature you will ever meet. I am my vets favorite little patient cause of my adorkableness. I do love my special toys, but boxes and just about any compartment is my favorite place to be. I am my mothers child and love all and any kinds of food and will be your best friend if you give me even the tiniest of treats. I may not be the easiest to catch and cuddle, but when I do, I am the softest and most scrumscious cuddle friend you shall ever have. I love to take walks in the outside world and explore in the warm weather..and just explore in general. Thank you for all the awesome adventures. Happy B-day Mother Dear!  </p>
	 	
	 		<h3>Penny</h3>
	 		<p class="big"> Hi there. My name is Penelope 'Penny' Lemon Boztepe and I came into this giant world on the warm evening of July 4, 2016. I am a newcomer into this place called Earth that I plan to take over with my awesome sass. My first language is Turkish and my favorite thing to do in times of boredom is to chase my tail and hop around like a bunny. I love cuddling with my Mama Bear except when I am wrestling with my big bro! I am special enough that I can actually run about 5 mph faster than Usain Bolt. Dogum gunun kutlu olsun annem tatlim!
